I cook Syrian food at home all the time. I make the same dishes that my grandmother and her grandmother cooked. I made mloukhiya and kibbeh the other day. As I come from a city known for its food, I enjoy cooking for my non-Syrian friends, to keep the memories of my city alive. What I most love about our food is that there is a story behind most of the dishes we make. My grandfather was a great cook. He used to tell me stories about the origin of every dish he made, and where its name came from. A lot of places in Sweden sell Arabic products, especially from Syria. There are now a lot of Syrian restaurants here. You can get most of our dishes, like stuffed eggplant (makdous), falafel, Arabic bread and others. I know from Syrian friends who ended up in Germany, Denmark and The Netherlands that it’s the same there. There is a special relationship between people and food, and what we eat is part of our Syrian identity. I forget that I’m in Sweden when we all get together at the dinner table - my friends and my family - and eat Syrian food and speak in our dialect of Arabic.
